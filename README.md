### Midas is a “Kickstarter for people’s time.”

Here’s how Midas works: You come up with a great idea that would help your workplace, but you and your coworkers don’t have the skills to execute it. Rather than bringing in a contractor, you can post your project idea to Midas, where other people within your organization can see it and then work on it, if they’d like.

Our Goal: to foster innovation across team boundaries by connecting individuals who identify challenges and then work collaboratively to implement solutions.

Basic Overview and Summary
--------------------------

Unicefjobs.ninja is a platform created in order to facilitate the process of applying for UNICEF opportunities. Users of the site will be able to log in or create an account with their email, fill out information regarding their employment and skills, and apply for jobs approved by UNICEF.

The basic process of becoming a new user is meant to be simple. The goal of the site is to make the application process easier and to allow people to easily browse jobs on the site. Upon landing on the home page, you can either Sign Up by creating a new account with your name, email address, and a password, or you can immediately look through a listing of jobs. After Signing Up for an account, you will be redirected to the profile page, so you can add relevant information regarding professional experience as well as your skills. It is important for the user to fill in as much information on the profile page as possible, as actually applying for a job requires certain information be filled in.

For new users that are already affiliated with UNICEF and wish to post job opportunities on the site, there is an option to sign up as a “job poster.” Job posters have the power to create new jobs within areas or choose not to put the job in an area. They do not have the power to edit or create areas and are basically limited to making new jobs on the site. They Sign Up similar to new users, on they sign up to become Job Posters and must be approved before being able to post jobs.

An important function of the site is that jobs are organized into different areas. The reasoning behind this is that people with certain skills will be able to quickly find jobs in specific areas. To make it easy for users to have access to jobs they are qualified for, areas have an option for users to be “vetted.” This is essentially a fast-track option for user that know they’ll be spending a lot of time searching and working is a specific area. In order for a user to get vetted they simply must apply to be vetted for a specific area, and then approved by an admin on the site. Vetting saves users and job posters the extra time it would take to ensure the user is a qualified candidate for the position.

It is important to note that while the site facilitates the application process of UNICEF opportunities, it does not actually handle the process itself. While applying for a job will notify the job poster of your interest, the process itself will be taken care of outside of the sites control, usually with the poster contacting the applicant via email. At this point, the application process is done formally, as it would be done without the site.
Unicefjobs.ninja is a utility for UNICEF and their volunteers to connect quickly and easily in order to make the volunteer process easier for people. Its main focus is the get users into the system and searching for jobs, so that when they apply it will be easy for UNICEF to sort through applications and contact qualified applicants.
